# ⚙️ GearGuard

## Project Overview

**GearGuard** is a sophisticated, enterprise-ready Multi-Tenant Maintenance Management System (CMMS) designed to maximize industrial uptime and streamline complex machinery maintenance workflows. It serves as a centralized "Control Tower" for organizations to manage assets, teams, and repair schedules with precision and transparency.

### 🌟 Core Value Propositions

#### � Enterprise Multi-Tenancy
GearGuard is built from the ground up to support multiple organizations on a single platform. 
- **Total Data Isolation**: Advanced architectural siloing ensures that every company's database records—from personnel files to sensitive asset telemetry—are strictly private.
- **Cross-Organization Security**: A robust security layer prevents data leakage, ensuring that a "Logistics" company cannot see the maintenance logs of a "Manufacturing" firm on the same system.

#### 🛠️ Precision Maintenance Lifecycle
Manage the entire lifecycle of a maintenance request from initial report to final sign-off.
- **Dynamic Kanban Board**: Visualize your workflow with a drag-and-drop interface. Move tasks through state transitions like *New*, *In-Progress*, *Repaired*, and *Scrap* with real-time updates.
- **Automated Workflows**: Intelligence-driven task routing automatically assigns incoming tickets to the pre-configured Maintenance Team and Technician assigned to a specific asset, reducing administrative overhead.

#### 📅 Intelligent Scheduling & Prevention
Move beyond reactive repairs to a proactive maintenance strategy.
- **Preventive Maintenance Calendar**: Schedule routine checkups and services weeks or months in advance. The interactive calendar provides a clear timeline of upcoming maintenance events.
- **Threshold-Based Alerts**: (Upcoming) Future integrations for sensor-based alerts and routine hour-meter tracking.

#### 📊 Operational Intelligence & Analytics
Turn your maintenance data into actionable business insights.
- **Technician Workload Analysis**: Monitor team performance and identify bottlenecks by tracking active task counts per technician.
- **Equipment Health Index**: Track the frequency and cost of repairs per machine to identify "Lemons" and optimize capital expenditure (CapEx) decisions.
- **Real-Time KPI Counters**: Instantly view total equipment count, active teams, and open high-priority requests from a unified dashboard.

#### 🔐 Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
GearGuard ensures that every user sees exactly what they need and nothing more.
- **Company Owners**: High-level visibility into company-wide operations and employee management.
- **Maintenance Managers**: Operational control over teams, equipment assignments, and workflow overrides.
- **Technicians**: Focused, distraction-free "My Tasks" view with easy status update interactions.
- **Staff Employees**: Simplified "Report-a-Problem" interface for rapid breakdown notification.
